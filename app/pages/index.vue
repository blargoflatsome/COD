<h1>Catacombs of Despair</h1>

<p>You come from a world much like our own — a place where magic is nothing more than myth, a story for children or fools. But a few years ago, an archaeological dig site began to stir whispers in the darkest corners of the internet, in closed circles, in late-night conversations between those who should know better.</p>

<p>The rumors vary wildly. Some say the tunnels beneath the site lead to Heaven. Others swear they descend into Hell. Still others claim they're something stranger — a door to worlds like Narnia or worse. Everyone seems to know someone who went in and came back changed... but no one can ever prove it. The stories contradict. The evidence is thin. And yet — something about it feels true.</p>

<p>Among the most credible voices, one message echoes again and again:
The tunnels give you what you desire most — even the things you won't admit you want.</p>

<p>They call it the Catacombs of Despair.
And for good reason. Only the desperate, the broken, or the truly foolish would dare to enter… let alone pay the ruinous fee demanded for passage.</p>

<p>In this game, you begin as a zero-level human commoner — an ordinary person driven by an extraordinary need. Each of you carries a private longing so deep it gnaws at your soul. Each of you is willing to risk everything — sanity, safety, even life itself — to chase a rumor into the dark.</p>

<p>Before each session, you'll set small goals — story beats that mark your path toward that final, desperate wish.</p>

<p>Because in the Catacombs, the tunnels will grant what your heart desires…
even if it has to destroy you to do it.</p>

<p>So ask yourself —
what would drive your character to gamble everything on a whispered legend at a bankrupting cost?
