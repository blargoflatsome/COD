## Bronze Horde (dice game)
Premise: raid up to 18 coastal villages; your outing score is how many you raid.

**Rules:**
- Roll 3d6 as many times as you like to approach 18 without exceeding it.
- The roll closest to 18 (without going over) is your score for that outing.
- Score target: first player to reach exactly 100 points wins.
- Special: rolling three sixes in a single throw grants an additional +10 points (representing captured slaves).

## Darts
- Players take turns rolling 1d20 and 1d6 both at once, three times. 
- The d20 determines what number they hit. 
- The d6 determines where on that number they hit. 
- First player to 301 wins the pot.
  
> For example, a 1 is the outer ring (double), a 3 is the inner ring (triple), while a 6 is the bull's eye (50). 

## Blackjack
- Each player has access to the following dice: d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4
- You pick which dice to roll and your objective is to get as close as you can to totaling 21 without going over.-
  - Once you roll a die, place it off to the side and it contributes to your total—you cannot use that die again this round. 
- First Round: Roll 2 Die
- Subsequent Rounds: Roll 1 Die
- One everyone holds: Closest to 21 without going over wins the pot.

## Threes Away Dice Game
- Players take turns rolling 5d6. 
- All numbers on the die are face value except for 3's which are worth 0.
