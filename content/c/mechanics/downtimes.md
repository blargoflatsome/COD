Downtimes are an optional way for you to stay enganged in the game between sessions and a way for your PC's to pursue goals, grow in power, and engage in the world in ways impossible during a typical once a month session.

Downtime is determined at the end of a session. You won't get downtime between games if your session ends mid encounter, but if you in a city and decide as a group that you want to stay in that city for a few days or weeks before setting off on your next adventure. Those days or weeks would be considered Downtime. You may also gain some Downtime when traveling long distances.

**Time as a Resource:**

When the players are given *Downtime* it will be expressed in *Days* or *Weeks*. These *Days* or *Weeks* can then be spent on *Actions*, which the DM will track. Once the total amount of time has been spent, the action will be completed.

## Actions

Actions are the things you can spend *Time* on during a *Downtime*. Some may also have additional Requirements that must be met.
