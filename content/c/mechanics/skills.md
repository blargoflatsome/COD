## Helping
One player may aid another player making a skill check. This gives the player making the check Advantage. The assisting player may use the same skill or a different skill they are **proficient** in so long as they can justify how it would help.

**Example**

A player proficient in Deception may attempt to aid a player making a Persuade skill check by using their skill in lying to quickly back up the player persuading. Providing cover stories should their attempt draw scrutiny they were unprepare for. Alternatively a player who is also proficient in Persuasion may just help lay it on thick.

## Critical Success or Failure
Per the book Crits/Fumbles do not impact skill checks. That is lame. If you do not have any chance to succeed, I simply won't let you roll for it. If I DO allow a roll then a Crit will succeed and a Fumble will fail. Often spectacularly.

## Taking Your Time

### Taking a Ten
If you have at least 10 minutes to attempt a task, you can simply take the time and add 10 to your Skill instead of rolling.

### Try  again
A PC may not try the same skill check twice on the same challenge. This may lead to another party member taking a crack at it. When this happens the other party members will each **Take a Ten**. For every PC who makes an attempt 10 minutes will pass. This keeps it in your best interest to always put your best roll forward.

## Success at a Cost
If a player fails a check but only by a little a DM may offer them a negative consequence in exchange for success. You dodge the fireball, but you are prone at the feet of an enemy. You manage to get their purse, but they notice you and call for the guards.

## Degrees of Failure
A DM may opt to say a failed Disarm Trap check by less than 5 doesn't set off the trap, but a failure of 5 or more does.

## Press your Luck
A skill check has failed and there is not time for another player to **Try Again** or the original character *Really* wants to take another try. The DM may offer an assured additional negative consequence, or an additional risk should the next attempt fail, in exchange for an additional attempt.
**Examples: **
- You fail to pick a lock, you may try again but if you fail the lock will break.
- You attempt to walk across the beam. If you stop now you can safely retreat back to the start, or at the risk of falling 60ft to the depths below you can try again.
- You have failed your Athletics check to hold the gate open, meaning it will fall and trap everyone inside. You can try again, but you will suffer exhaustion. A different player may try to help in order to grant advantage but the gate will fully close if you fail.

## Target Success/Failures
A difficult action is being attempted. A target number of successes is set and the player will continue making skill checks until they acheive that target number. Optionally a failure counter can also be set, where if they fail a number of times before succeeding a number of times the challenge is lost.

**Example**

- A Rogue is trying to crack a safe. They must succeed at 3 sleight of hand checks before they fail twice or the alarm goes off.
- A player is swimming against the current of a river, they must succeed at 2 athletics checks to reach the other side. Their first failure will result in exhaustion. A second failure will result in being swept away.

## Progression Clock
The players are, as a group, trying to complete a complex action. The DM sets the "counter" and the conditions that will cause the clock to tick forward. Such as a failed Skill Checks, or any d20 roll. The players then must complete their business before the clock runs out.

**Example**

- Sneaking into a facility. The clock is the security system with every failed roll raising the alarm until the facility becomes aware and on high alert. A player may cast spells or take actions that ensure another player gains advantage on their skill roll. One player may use stealth to get the party past a sleeping guard and fail, the clock moves forward as the guard wakes up. Now the players need to deal with this situation. Perhaps they succeed at deception or persuasion, or knock the guard out. They all roll stealth, one of them fails. The clock moves forward as the noise catches attention deeper in the facility. It is a race between the clock and the challenges to obtain their objective.
- A ritual is being cast, each round draws it close to success. The players only have a certain amount of rounds (or actions) to stop the ritual.

## Travel
The players will all complete the following skill checks if they are at risk of an encounter during travel.
- Survival to ensure you arrive safely, find cover from weather, tracking a target, or find a place to rest.
- Stealth to ensure you were not followed, did not attract a predator, hid your resting place.
- Perception to ensure you do not get lost, ambushed, or detect other potential complications.
- A player may roll a different skill, or perform a different action (such as casting spell), if they can justify it.

A critical success will cancel a different players failure. A critical failure will cancel another players success.

The results of each skill check will be considered by the DM when setting up the encounter.

## Wisdom vs Intelligence
Wisdom checks allow characters to perceive what is around them (the wall is clean here), while Intelligence checks answer why things are that way (there’s probably a secret door).
