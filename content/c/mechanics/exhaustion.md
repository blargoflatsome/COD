While you have the Exhaustion condition, you experience the following effects.

Exhaustion Levels. This condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.

D20 Tests Affected. When you make a D20 Test, the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.

Speed Reduced. Your Speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.

Removing Exhaustion Levels. Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.

## Homebrew
When you have exausted your "per day" class abilities you can take a level of Exhaustion to push yourself past your limits to do more.

Casting a spell when you are out of Spell Slots costs 1 level of Exhaustion per spell level. This does mean casting a level 6 spell will kill you, but not before the spell is cast.
