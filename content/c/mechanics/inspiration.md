You may never have more than 5 Inspiration at a time.

If you (a player character) have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll.

During a long rest an Inspiration may be spent to remove 1 level of Despair.

These Inspiration points may also be used to 'haggle' with the DM to influence the narrative. This may be to allow you an action you wouldn't normally get because it would be cool for the scene or character, or even to influence something such as 'if I give up 2 inspiration could there be a lore book in this bookshelf?'

Other uses for Inspiration may reveal themselves during play.
