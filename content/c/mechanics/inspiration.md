## What is Inspiration
Inspiration is a meta-currency. Typically the DM will award it to reward behavior they like to see in game. Players may also nominate each other when they see someone doing something swell. This is intented as a way to keep things friendly above table even if they get tense in game.

## Gaining Inspiration
Anytime a player does something epic they may get an Inspiration. This could be bringing snacks to game, having an intense RP scene, coming up with a plan that actually works, or any number of other things.

### Inspiration Cap
You may never have more than 5 Inspiration at a time. 

## Uses for Inspiration
You will gain it pretty frequently so do not be afraid to use it.

### By the book
You may expend it to reroll any die immediately after **you** rolling it, then you must use the new roll.

### Despair System
During a long rest an Inspiration may be spent to remove 1 level of Despair.

### The Rule of Cool
These Inspiration points may also be used to 'haggle' with the DM to influence the narrative. This may be to allow you an action you wouldn't normally get because it would be cool for the scene or character, or even to influence something small such as 'if I give up 2 inspiration could there be a lore book in this bookshelf to help me accomplish my Story Beat?' **The DM has final say and does not need to be consistent.**

### Occult Rites
You may learn Occult Rites in game. Inspiration is how you power them. To learn more see [Occult Rites](/c/mechanics/occult-rites/)
