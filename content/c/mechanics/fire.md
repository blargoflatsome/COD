## Fire Spread Rules

**Oil.** You can pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.

**Tinderbox.** This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

**Alchemist's Fire.** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

**Fireball** The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

## House Rule Clarifications
Flammable for game purposes will be obvious items like dry grass, leaves, paper, curtains, etc.

Doors, trees, wooden floors, and the like will merely be scorched black unless the fire lasts for a minimun of two rounds. Such as if Oil was applied.At the start of the second round it would have a 10% chance of catching the objects on fire, which could then spread at the top of the following round. If it does not the oil would simply putter out at the end of its second round.
