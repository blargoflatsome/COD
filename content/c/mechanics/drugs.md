## Addiction:
If you take a drug with an Addiction DC more than once between long rests you must make a Wisdom Save at the start of your long rest.
The DC is set by the drug + the number of hits you have taken that day. 
Failure means you gain the condition **addicted** to that drug. 

## Condition: Addicted:
You suffer a permanent level of Exhaustion when not actively on the drug you addicted too.

### Getting a Fix
The point of Exhaustion from Addicted is removed when you take the drug you are addicted too. However, it not only returns when the drug wears off again you must also make a DC 15 Constitution Save or gain an additional level of Exhaustion. This additional level of Exhaustion is treated normally. You may avoid this by taking another hit of the drug.

### Withdrawal Complications
If the drug pushes you to your 6th level of Exhaustion you run the risk of dying. You must immediately begin making Death Saving Throws. 
Any non magical attempt to stabilize and heal you is made with Disadvantage.

## Overdose Check
Some drugs have a risk of overdose if taken multiple times in a day. 
Failure on an Overdose Check puts you in Death Saving Throws just like with **Withdrawal Complications**.
The DC of an Overdose Check is set by the drug + the number of doses you have taken that day.

## Indentify a Drug
To learn the properties, dangers, and side effects of any drug requires 2 days downtime, a test subject, and a skill check determined by the DM. Alternatively you can simply take the drug and learn the effects first hand.
