### Arena Fights (Mini Game) (HB)
#### Favor Of The Crowd
Only one fighter can have the Favor of the Crowd at a time. When Favor is earned it may be spent as described below but the crowds are fickle. Anytime a fighter does something to earn Favor they take it from whomever currently has it.

**Spend Favor**
- Stabilize
  - When you would drop to 0 hit points or fewer, you can spend the favor of the crowd to fight on. You drop to 1 hit point and remain on your feet.
- Critical Bonus Attack
  - When you score a critical hit against a foe, if you already had the Favor of the Crowd, you can spend it to immediately make a single melee weapon attack against a foe (the same one you hit or another one) as a Bonus Action.
- Gain Advantage
  - On your turn, you can spend the favor of the crowd to gain advantage on a single melee weapon attack.
- Excite the Crowd
  - You may use the Favor of the Crowd to change the Attitude of the Crowd from Indifferent to Hostile or Hostile to Friendly.

#### Sway The Crowd
Party members not involved in the Combat may attempt to sway the Attitude of the Crowd in your favor by making a Charisma (Performance) check against a DC set by the crowd's current attitude toward you. They roll with Advantage if you have the Favor of the Crowd currently.

- DC 20 to go from Indifferent to Friendly
- DC 15 to go from Indifferent to Hostile
- DC 10 to go from Hostile to Friendly
  
#### Gaining Favor
- Scoring a Critical Hit on an opponent 
- Dropping a foe to 0 hit points with an attack.
- Performance. Spend 1 Action to make a Charisma (Performance) check against a DC set by the crowd's attitude toward you.
  - DC 10 for Friendly: You are the people's champion.
  - DC 15 for Hostile: You are the heel and the people love to hate you.
  - DC 20 for Indifferent: You have bored the crowd and they do not care if you win or lose.

### Losing Favor
- Opponent Claims Favor.
- You Fumble. (The Attitude of the Crowd also changes to Indifferent.)
- You (or a party member rolling on your behalf) fails a Charisma (Performance) check.
