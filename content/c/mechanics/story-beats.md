> This is an experimental leveling system and is subject to change during play.

Story Beats are little milestones in your character's story, and advancement is simple; you choose two Personal and one Party Story Beat at the end of each session (and at character creation);  if you trigger the circumstances of each beat, you gain xp! Once you've hit a given beat you can't choose it again. Two players may not take the same Story Beat at the same time. A beat that hasn't been achieved can be abandoned at the end of a session and replaced or kept for the next session.

When picking Story Beats remember your Desperation; the DM will consider how your Story Beats bring you closer to acheiving it.

2 Basic Goals = 1xp
1 Advanced Goal = 1xp
1 Party Goals = 1xp/each
4xp = 1 Level

> The presented Story Beats are examples, if you think of something not listed present it to the DM for approval.
