## Public Knowledge:
Silas Hale is the leader of a cult known as The Unbound Chains. The cult was in operation for a total of 10 years before it was investigated for tax evasion which lead to the discovery of its ties to human trafficking, forced labor, and many accusations of sexual misconduct. Before he could be sentenced Silas Hale went missing with many suspecting he used his connections to go underground. They were partially correct as Silas, in an attempt to remain free, fled into the Catacombs of Despair.
