Cassian is a Tiefling Traveler that has retired to a tall tower outside of Gear City. From his tower he waits and greets all new Travelers who arrive. He enjoys hearing their stories and guiding them on their way.

## Previous Life
Cassian was a defense lawyer who passed the threshold to be absolved of his guilt. A task he does not claim to have completed but one that drove him to creating The Ledger.

## The Ledger
Cassian also leads an organization known as The Ledger. A sort of bounty hunter/karmic justice group that ensures moral judgement reaches those skilled at escaping the law.

## Character Relations
Greeted the party in his tower before it was interupted by a strange figure in dark robes wielding psionic power. During the attack his life was saved by the combined efforts of Beef, Tofu, and Bob. Bob discovered his power to heal but the wound refused to bind, while Beef and Tofu used their combined knowledge of medical training to treat the wound the old fashioned way.

To aid his guests in dealing with the mysterious robed figure he gifted Tofu with gauntlets of thieving and then swore they could claim any treasure they desired within his tower as payment for not simply abandoning him and his men. He also requested that they not kill his men who had fallen under the mental control of the intruder.

To their credit they knocked out two of his men in the stairwell, then locked them inside the cell with Cassian. They releaved them of their weapons and copper first, of course.
