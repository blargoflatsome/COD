## Set Your Desperation

Your Desperation is your ultimate reason for entering the Catacombs.  
What are you so desperate to accomplish that you would risk descending into the Catacombs of Despair?

### Adrenaline / Adventure Seeking
- **Death-Chaser**  
  They no longer fear death and actively seek a foe strong enough to end them—yet want to see the terror in its eyes when it realizes it must try.
- **The Great Hunter**  
  They have hunted everything on land and sea and now crave the ultimate rush: hunting the greatest monsters beneath the earth.
- **Proving Superiority**  
  They believe most people are weak, and delving into the Catacombs is how they prove they are fundamentally above lesser mortals—alive or dead.
- **To Escape a Terminal Diagnosis**
  They are dying.
  Cancer, organ failure, a degenerative disease—something the modern world cannot stop.
  They can spend their last months in a hospital bed… or walk into the Heart and see whether something deeper beneath reality can rewrite their fate.
  Either way, they die on their terms.

### Exploration / Knowledge
- **Mapping the Dead World**  
  They believe the Catacombs mirror the architecture of the afterlife and want to chart it in preparation for their own carefully planned death.
- **Unearthing Pre-Cataclysm Civilizations**  
  They seek proof of an ancient, advanced culture that predates recorded history, and the Catacombs are their last solid lead.
- **Harvesting Forbidden Anatomy**  
  They want to dissect ancient undead or aberrations, seeking grotesque biological secrets or materials for forbidden experiments.
- **To Cure the Uncurable**
  Someone they love—child, partner, sibling—is dying of a terminal illness. Modern medicine has failed.
  They descend hoping to return with the cure… or failing that, to die trying so their loved one doesn’t have to watch them fail again.

### Loss / Pursuit
- **Dragging Back What Should Stay Dead**  
  They seek a dead loved one and intend to use forbidden rites to force their return—whether the soul agrees or not.
- **Chasing a Kidnapped Companion**  
  A traveling companion was abducted by cultists who retreated underground; they are here to bring them back or die trying.
- **Hungry for the Soul of Their Betrayer**  
  They pursue the spirit of someone who wronged them—not for closure, but to consume or bind it.
- **To Fulfill a Vow They Cannot Break**
  A promise they made—a deathbed vow, a sacred oath, a pact between friends—cannot be honored in the mundane world. They go below to keep a promise that would otherwise die with them.
- **To Find Meaning After Losing Everything**
  A life collapse—divorce, bankruptcy, a ruined reputation, a career destroyed—has left them with nothing. If they die in the Catacombs, at least their life ends in pursuit of something larger than themselves.
  

### Penitence
- **Seeking Punishment**  
  They committed a grave sin and believe surviving the Catacombs is the only path to redemption—or dying within is the punishment they deserve.
- **Atonement Quest from a Priest or Oracle**  
  A spiritual authority has sent them below to retrieve a relic or perform a sacred rite as penance.
- **Self-Flagellation Through Horror**  
  They descend not for redemption but to accumulate suffering, equating agony with spiritual purification.
- **To Undo a Personal Catastrophe**
  They descend seeking the impossible: forgiveness.

### Meaning / Occult / Religion
- **Wants to Birth a New God**  
  They believe the Catacombs hold remnants of a dead deity and hope to stitch it together with blood—whether theirs or others.
- **Aspires to Become a Living Saint of Filth**  
  They believe enlightenment lies in decay, rot, and corruption, and the Catacombs are the crucible for their transformation.
- **Searching for the First Saint / First Monster**  
  Legends say the Catacombs house the remains of a primordial being—saint, monster, or both. They seek contact, relics, or truth.
- **To End Their Life in a Place That Gives Their Death Meaning**
  They want their death to matter to the world—or at least to themselves.

### Forced / Employed
- **Disposable Cleaner**  
  Hired to erase evidence of past expeditions—bodies, journals, and signs of what truly happened.
- **Blackmailed Into It**  
  Someone holds a dangerous secret over them and demands they retrieve something from the depths.
- **Sold Into the Catacombs**  
  A noble or creditor literally traded them as payment; someone inside owns their fate.

### Madness
- **Trying to Find Their Other Self**  
  They believe a better version of them lives deeper below—and intend to kill that version and steal its life.
- **Irresistible Hallucinatory Call**  
  They dream nightly of a door in the Catacombs—each dream clearer and closer—and can no longer ignore it.
- **Convinced They Are a Reincarnated Ancient**  
  They believe they once lived within the Catacombs in a past life and are desperately trying to return “home.”
- **To Stop a Prophetic Catastrophe Only They Believe**
  They’ve seen visions—dreams, hallucinations, or messages from something they don’t understand—showing a disaster approaching the real world.
  No one believes them.
  But the source of the visions lies deeper. They descend to confront it, bargain with it, or kill it.

### Revenge
- **Hunting the Monster That Took Everything**  
  A creature from below killed or maimed someone dear; they refuse to rest until it dies by their hand.
- **Destroying the Cult Within**  
  A Catacombs-dwelling cult committed atrocities against their family; they seek bloody retribution.
- **Kill Their Doppelganger**  
  Someone—or something—impersonated them in the real world. Rumors whisper the double came from the Catacombs.
