## Set Your Desperation

Your Desperation is your ultimate reason for entering the Catacombs.  
What are you so desperate to accomplish that you would risk descending into the Catacombs of Despair?

### Adrenaline / Adventure Seeking
- **Death-Chaser**  
  They no longer fear death and actively seek a foe strong enough to end them—yet want to see the terror in its eyes when it realizes it must try.
- **The Great Hunter**  
  They have hunted everything on land and sea and now crave the ultimate rush: hunting the greatest monsters beneath the earth.
- **Proving Superiority**  
  They believe most people are weak, and delving into the Catacombs is how they prove they are fundamentally above lesser mortals—alive or dead.

### Exploration / Knowledge
- **Mapping the Dead World**  
  They believe the Catacombs mirror the architecture of the afterlife and want to chart it in preparation for their own carefully planned death.
- **Unearthing Pre-Cataclysm Civilizations**  
  They seek proof of an ancient, advanced culture that predates recorded history, and the Catacombs are their last solid lead.
- **Harvesting Forbidden Anatomy**  
  They want to dissect ancient undead or aberrations, seeking grotesque biological secrets or materials for forbidden experiments.

### Loss / Pursuit
- **Dragging Back What Should Stay Dead**  
  They seek a dead loved one and intend to use forbidden rites to force their return—whether the soul agrees or not.
- **Chasing a Kidnapped Companion**  
  A traveling companion was abducted by cultists who retreated underground; they are here to bring them back or die trying.
- **Hungry for the Soul of Their Betrayer**  
  They pursue the spirit of someone who wronged them—not for closure, but to consume or bind it.

### Penitence
- **Seeking Punishment**  
  They committed a grave sin and believe surviving the Catacombs is the only path to redemption—or dying within is the punishment they deserve.
- **Atonement Quest from a Priest or Oracle**  
  A spiritual authority has sent them below to retrieve a relic or perform a sacred rite as penance.
- **Self-Flagellation Through Horror**  
  They descend not for redemption but to accumulate suffering, equating agony with spiritual purification.

### Meaning / Occult / Religion
- **Wants to Birth a New God**  
  They believe the Catacombs hold remnants of a dead deity and hope to stitch it together with blood—whether theirs or others.
- **Aspires to Become a Living Saint of Filth**  
  They believe enlightenment lies in decay, rot, and corruption, and the Catacombs are the crucible for their transformation.
- **Searching for the First Saint / First Monster**  
  Legends say the Catacombs house the remains of a primordial being—saint, monster, or both. They seek contact, relics, or truth.

### Forced / Employed
- **Disposable Cleaner**  
  Hired to erase evidence of past expeditions—bodies, journals, and signs of what truly happened.
- **Blackmailed Into It**  
  Someone holds a dangerous secret over them and demands they retrieve something from the depths.
- **Sold Into the Catacombs**  
  A noble or creditor literally traded them as payment; someone inside owns their fate.

### Madness
- **Trying to Find Their Other Self**  
  They believe a better version of them lives deeper below—and intend to kill that version and steal its life.
- **Irresistible Hallucinatory Call**  
  They dream nightly of a door in the Catacombs—each dream clearer and closer—and can no longer ignore it.
- **Convinced They Are a Reincarnated Ancient**  
  They believe they once lived within the Catacombs in a past life and are desperately trying to return “home.”

### Revenge
- **Hunting the Monster That Took Everything**  
  A creature from below killed or maimed someone dear; they refuse to rest until it dies by their hand.
- **Destroying the Cult Within**  
  A Catacombs-dwelling cult committed atrocities against their family; they seek bloody retribution.
- **Kill Their Doppelganger**  
  Someone—or something—impersonated them in the real world. Rumors whisper the double came from the Catacombs.
