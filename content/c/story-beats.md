> This is an experimental leveling system and is subject to change during play.

## How it works
Story Beats are little milestones in your character's story, and advancement is simple: 

you choose **2 Basic**, **1 Advanced** and as a group you pick **1 Party** Story Beat at the end of each session (and at character creation). If you trigger the circumstances of a Story Beat during play, you gain XP!

### Be Aware That...
- Once you've acheived a given Story Beat you can't choose it again.
- Two players may not take the same Story Beat at the same time. 
- A beat that hasn't been achieved may be abandoned at the end of a session and replaced or kept for the next session.
- You will never have more than 2 Basic, 1 Advanced, and 1 Party Beat active at any time.

> **Important**: 
> you only get credit for accomplishing active Story Beats. So if you get cursed but don't have "get cursed" as a Story Beat, you don't get credit.

### XP
- 2 basic = 1 XP  
- 1 advanced = 1 XP  
- 1 party = 1 XP each  
- 6 XP = 1 level

> **Important**:
> Remember your desperation; Story Beats bring you closer to acheiving your Desperation. They will be interpreted by the DM in that context.

### Extra Details
My goal is to keep each of you roughly the same level, so this system also allows me to see who to focus on and ensure I'm not ignoring anyone as I try to provide each of you opportunities to complete your goals.

The party goals are another way to ensure everyone is gaining XP. They also keep you all on the same page with what you are ultimately trying to do. They may even give each of you clear ways to betray the party in order to accomplish personal goals. 

### A Note on Player v.S. Player
Normally you might be tempted to feel bad about working against the party, but nobody can fault a player for gaining XP. Just be prepared to deal with the in-character consequences. The other players may not hold it against you, but their character will.

PVP is allowed so long as it is fun and fits the story. Killing a fellow party member is lazy and not fun. Earning your own XP by getting tricky revenge on a fellow player is fun.

## Picking Story Beats
Story Beats are broken down by character archetype just to help with organization. You can pick them from any list. Take your time and look over each list. You may find Story Beats that fit well together or Story Beats you can do now that will open opportunities to accomplish others later.

> Disclaimer: The presented Story Beats are merely examples. If you think of something not listed, or wish to modify one, present it to the DM for approval. Especially as you get to know your character and their personal story better.

15. Do a favor for someone to gain leverage over them.

18. Accept a whisper that never stops: an entity implants a voice in your mind. You must act on at least one of its suggestions, even as you realize its goals are not your own.
19. Give a name to something that should remain nameless: you identify an eldritch thing—granting it definition and power. Its new identity clings to you, creating a bond you cannot easily sever.

7. Let an occult presence use your body as its vessel: for a brief but intense moment, you give permission for a spirit, spell, sentience, or conceptual entity to act through you. You remain conscious, aware of your loss of control, and bear the consequences afterward.
8. Rise in rank within your occult faction.
9. Discover a forbidden archive.

7. A faction, cult, or lone survivor blames you for a catastrophe. Instead of defending yourself, you kneel and accept whatever consequence they demand.
8. A person wronged by you (or who simply believes they were) refuses absolution. You must carry a physical or spiritual burden for them—hauling their supplies, absorbing a curse, or doing some degrading task—despite their rejection.
9. Allow a curse—lingering, viral, psychic, or subterranean—to cling to you instead of someone else. The curse must meaningfully constrain or transform you.
10. Destroy a part of yourself to prove your change. This can be physical (a scarification, a ritual amputation), social (burning your reputation), or metaphysical (severing a bond, surrendering a gift). The act must permanently change you or your capabilities.
