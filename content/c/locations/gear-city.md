Floating high above Tier 1 Gear City is home to many retired Travelers and factions. Many of the citizens take a drug called Joy to stay off the despair natural to this world and believe that by floating their city they have achieved a greater level of stability and normalcy. Some even claim that if they could find the power to fly even higher they may even find a way back to the "real" world.
