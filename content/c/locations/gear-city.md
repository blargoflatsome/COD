Floating high above Tier 1 Gear City is home to many retired Travelers and factions. Many of the citizens take a drug called Joy to stay off the despair natural to this world and believe that by floating their city they have achieved a greater level of stability and normalcy. Some even claim that if they could find the power to fly even higher they may even find a way back to the "real" world.

Gear City is a floating market and manufacturing city with cobblestone streets centered on a lake that leads to a waterfall. Smokestacks pump green smog into the air blocking any clear view of the sky, while ships can be seen sailing down the waterfall. Yet no ships ever return.

Surrounding the city is a forest that seems to move on it's own and in that forest is Cassian's Tower.
