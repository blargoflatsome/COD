# Catacombs of Despair

You are from a world much like our own where magic is believed to be a work of fiction. However, a few years ago an archeological dig site has quickly become a place of legend within the hushest of whispers.

Rumors of these tunnels range as you would expect them too. Everything from the gates to hell or heaven as out there as Narnia itself. Those who know of it all seem to know a guy who knows a guy who went into the tunnels and returned, but nobody can be verified and proof is flimsy at best. 

However, among the most credible of sources the message is the same. The tunnels will provide the desires you even keep secret from yourself.

The tunnels have been called the Catacombs of Despair; for truly only the most fool hearty or desperate would dare go in let alone raise enough money to pay the increasingly high fee. 

In  this game you each will begin play as a zero level human commoner. Each with your own desperate desire to enter the catacombs. Before each session you will set goals for the next session like story beats. Smaller goals you wish to accomplish to lead you on your way to that final desperate wish. Each session the Catacombs will fulfill your hearts desire even if it has to kill you trying.

What would compel your character to risk everything on a hushed rumor at bankrupting cost?
